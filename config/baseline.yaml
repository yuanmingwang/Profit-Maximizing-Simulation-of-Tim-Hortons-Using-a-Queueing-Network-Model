# Baseline configuration values
arrival_rates:
  ## piecewise-constant poisson arrival rates per channel (customers/min) for dayparts
  # Each triple [a, b, λ] means: from minute a (inclusive) to minute b (exclusive) after store opening, arrivals occur at rate λ customers per minute.
  # So [0, 60, 0.6] = from t=0 to t=60 minutes, expect 0.6 walk-ins per minute (~36/hour).
  # The list of triples stitches together a whole day.
